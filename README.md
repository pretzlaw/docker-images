# Docker container

## Packages

This extends:

- [hub.alterway.fr](https://github.com/alterway/docker-php)

Those projects are fully merged into this repository to keep a better track of changes.
The `update.sh` script helps fetching them and their latest version.
Unfortunately this is necessary as long as the third-party config
or images are not public.
